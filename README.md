# Face-Detection
The program detects faces on the image from the webcam, counts the time when a face is observed and displays a graph showing how long someone was in front of the computer.

Required python libraries:

* Matplotlib

* Pandas

* OpenCV

To start the program enter the following command in the terminal:

python script.py

The window showing the image from the webcam will be displayed. If the program detects a face, it draws a green rectangle around it. The time while the face is present is counted and then saved in the Time.csv file. 

To close the program, press "q". Then, the program will display a graph presenting how much time (in hours) the computer has been used by a person in a given day. Press 'q' again to close the program completely.
